            hushfile.it is a file sharing site where the file is <b>encrypted before upload</b>. 
            This enables you to share files while <b>keeping them private</b> from server operators or eavesdroppers. 
            Just pick a file and it will be <b>encrypted in your browser</b> before it is uploaded. 
            When the process is finished you will receive a link which you can share with anyone you wish. 
            Just <b>keep the link secret</b>, it contains the password to decrypt the file!
        </div>

            <h4>Background</h4>
            The idea for hushfile came from the pastebin <a href="https://ezcrypt.it/">ezcrypt.it</a>. Ezcrypt.it is like
            a normal pastebin, except that it encrypts the pasted text before it is uploaded to the server.
            Hushfile is a file-version of ezcrypt.it, an easy way to share files with those you wish to share with,
            and noone else. This might seem like a subtle difference from a normal pastebin or filesharing service, 
            but it is a <b>great</b> idea. I firmly believe that the best way to promote privacy online is to put 
            <b>easy to use encryption</b> into the hands of the end users. People are lazy, but if a private 
            alternative is as easy to use as a non-private one, the choice is easy.
