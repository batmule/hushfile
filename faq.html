            <dd>
                The file it's metadata are both encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding. The actual encryption is performed by the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/" target="_blank">CryptoJS 3.1.2</a> library. From their website:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.</p>
